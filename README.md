Processiva

Cohesiva Processes Engine

An idea of **Processiva** is to provide a **platform** for supporting **business process** execution in Cohesiva (or any other company). Process flow and process description relies on the jBpm engine. The grassroots of this idea is that we need the business process automation for most of the rudimentary tasks that are awkward to make the company life simpler and easier for everyone. Processiva wants to:
- automate the document flow
- not to make people remember dates - rather remind about them
- manage the mail merge
- fill in repetitive form data
- be helpful for newbie or Mr Forgetful
