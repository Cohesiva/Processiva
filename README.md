Processiva
==========

Cohesiva Processes Engine

An idea of **Processiva** is to provide a **platform** for supporting **business process** execution in Cohesiva (or any other company). Process flow and process description relies on the jBpm engine. The grassroots of this idea is that we need the business process automation for most of the rudimentary tasks that are awkward to make the company life simpler and easier for everyone. Processiva wants to:
- automate the document flow
- not to make people remember dates - rather remind about them
- manage the mail merge
- fill in repetitive form data
- be helpful for newbie or Mr Forgetful
- organize communication

The typical technologies employed are:
- jBPM
- Spring
- Spring MVC
- RESTful webservices
- JPA
- Maven



## Who is Processiva for?
The platform is for **everyone** who wants to develop it together with Cohesiva in spirit of **opensource**.
We offer a ready to use environment for the start and give an opportunity to lace into coding keeping in mind that it will increase community activity and help people know each other better improving their cooperation and skills.
We do not force any one to anything. We rathe count on people creativity and initiative. Every idea is valuable and your will is the principle.
